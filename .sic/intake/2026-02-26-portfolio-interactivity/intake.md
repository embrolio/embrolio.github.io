# Intake: Portfolio Interactivity & Easter Eggs

**Created:** 2026-02-26
**Status:** needs_research
**Source:** verbal brainstorm

## Description
Add eye-catching interactive elements to the portfolio site that enhance the dark minimalist cyberpunk atmosphere without breaking it. Focus on:
- **Hidden easter eggs** — secrets that reward exploration
- **Reactive elements** — respond to user input in clever ways
- **Humor/personality** — programming jokes, dev puns, witty touches

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Research completed: catalog of creative portfolio interactivity patterns
- [ ] 3-5 specific features selected for implementation
- [ ] Each feature maintains single-file architecture
- [ ] Total additions stay within ~100-200 lines of code
- [ ] All features work on both desktop and mobile (touch-friendly)

## Context
- Current site: Single-file static HTML with particle canvas, avatar system, typewriter effects
- Stack: Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, zero dependencies
- Vibe: Dark, minimalist, cyberpunk, space-themed
- Existing interactivity: Custom cursor, particle trails, category auto-cycling, hat swaps

## Constraints
- MUST NOT add build tools or external dependencies
- MUST maintain single-file architecture
- SHOULD NOT significantly impact page load or performance
- SHOULD feel cohesive with existing aesthetic (not tacked-on)

## Notes
- User wants to see what other creative portfolios are doing before committing to features
- "Keep it simple" is still a priority — polish over quantity
- Programming-related humor fits the target audience (devs/recruiters)

## Research Needed
- [ ] Survey creative developer portfolios for interactivity patterns
- [ ] Catalog easter egg implementations (konami codes, secret clicks, hidden messages)
- [ ] Document reactive element patterns (mouse effects, scroll triggers, typing responses)
- [ ] Collect examples of dev humor in portfolios (console messages, error pages, copy)
- [ ] Identify mobile-friendly alternatives to hover-based interactions
